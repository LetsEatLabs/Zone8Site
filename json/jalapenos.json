The temperature must be at least 70\u00b0 F for seed germination, so keep them in a warm area for the best results. Plant them 1/4 inch deep in seed-starting formula. Keep the soil moist at 75 degrees F. Seedlings emerge in 7-21 days.", "care-instructions": "As soon as seedlings emerge, provide plenty of light on a sunny windowsill or grow seedlings 3-4 inches beneath fluorescent plant lights turned on 16 hours per day, off for 8 hours at night. Raise the lights as the plants grow taller. Incandescent bulbs will not work for this process because they will get too hot. Most plants require a dark period to grow, do not leave lights on for 24 hours. Seedlings do not need much fertilizer, feed when they are 3-4 weeks old using a starter solution (half strength of a complete indoor houseplant food) according to manufacturer\u2019s directions.", "harvest-instructions": "Harvest when peppers are green or fully colored and firm. Harvesting must be done carefully. Cut the fruit from the plant with a garden scissors or pruner. Keep peppers picked to encourage more to form."}}
